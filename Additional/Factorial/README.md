# What can this be used for?

As Modular wraps around the numbers in a certain range, it can effectively be used to
contain player characters or player rotation within a certain range

For example, when the turret of a tank is rotating and it reaches the point where it is
more than 359 degree. It can basically wrap around and start from 0 degree.
